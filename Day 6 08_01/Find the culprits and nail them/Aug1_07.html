    <p>
        var a = "2" > "12"; => When comparing two strings, "2" will be greater than "12", because (alphabetically) 1 is
        less than 2. To secure a proper result, variables should be converted to the proper type before comparison. The
        output has been corrected as required and it is displayed in the console!!!
