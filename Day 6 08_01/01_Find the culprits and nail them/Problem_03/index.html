    <p>
        1.) <b> alert('Hello') </b> => Semicolon is optional in Javascript. there will be no error in the statement, but
        it is good practice to use semicolons al the end. Mostly the semicolons are used to differentiate b/w 2 line if
        they are written in the same line
    </p>
    <p>
        2.) <b> alert(`Wor <br>
            ld`) </b>=> ` is called the Template Literals. Template literals are string literals allowing embedded
        expressions. You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with them
    </p>
    <p>
        3.) <b>alert(3 + <br>
            1 <br>
            + 2) </b> => This is called the multi line code. Here the '+' acts as the multi line continuation character.
        The + after 3 will add the next line to it and the + before the 2 will connnect it to the second line;
